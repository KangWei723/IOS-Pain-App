# Pain-App
Purpose: Recording of pain localization and intensity is a common issue in Plastic Surgery and other medical fields. There is no easy solution for patients to report information about their pain. Similarly, medical professionals would also prefer to have some objective and efficient way of collecting information about patientâ€™s pain.  This project will focus on building an easy to use application that will allow patients the ability to report information about their pain such as pain level, location of the pain, pain character, number of days since the pain started, etc directly through the app. Medical professionals will then be able to access this information through the application, store and import this data into IHIS and be able to use it in the future for clinical and research purposes.  Finally, the tool will play a vital role in refining nerve surgeries by using the pain data collected from patients.
